Properties of a BST

a) For a node its left child should be less than the node and the right child should be greater than the node there is no case of equal to here

b) And also this property should be followed in all the subtrees of the tree

c) what if there are equal nodes? //duplicates

-> Ideally not allowed
-> Agar duplicates hai to l<node<r ko thora change kar do l<=node<r ya fir counter

d) Why study BST?

-> Because generally O(log2n) height only for skewed trees O(n) but that is very rare
